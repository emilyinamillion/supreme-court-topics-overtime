## Supreme Court Topics Over Time

This is a project by @emilyinamillion that utilizes topic modeling with Non Negative Matrix factorization (python) and has an accompanying D3.js visualization. 

If you came here for the topic modeling, [one of my ipython notebooks](https://github.com/emilyinamillion/supreme-court-topics-overtime/blob/master/pipeline/Step4_pipeline_Model-testing.ipynb) walks through the other algorithms I tried as well as my reasoning for why I settled on NMF.

If you came here for the D3.js, the visualization folder is the entire contents of the live D3.js visualization currently available on Bl.ocks. The visualization lives [here](https://emilyinamillion.me/supreme-court-topics-visualization/index.html).
