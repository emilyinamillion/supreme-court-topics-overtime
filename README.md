## Supreme Court Topics Over Time

This is a project by @emilyinamillion that utilizes topic modeling with Non Negative Matrix factorization (python) and has an accompanying D3.js visualization. Read the blog post [here](http://www.emilyinamillion.me/blog/2016/7/13/visualizing-supreme-court-topics-over-time)!

If you came here for the topic modeling, [one of my ipython notebooks](https://github.com/emilyinamillion/supreme-court-topics-overtime/blob/master/pipeline/Step4_pipeline_Model-testing.ipynb) walks through the other algorithms I tried as well as my reasoning for why I settled on NMF.

If you came here for the D3.js, the visualization folder is the entire contents of the live D3.js visualization currently available on Bl.ocks. The visualization lives [here](http://bl.ocks.org/emilyinamillion/raw/39502f1eddde316b2448c73fb9c20b73/).
