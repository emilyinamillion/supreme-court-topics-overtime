    "# Topic Modeling with various methods\n",
    "Topic modeling is a powerful tool for quickly sorting through a lot of text and documents without having to read every one. There are several methods available for this using python, as well as several libraries. Topic modeling is extremely challenging to get meaningful results. \"Garbage in, garbage out\" is a phrase that applies well to this - we have to do a significant amount of text preprocessing to extract the right information to feed into a model. On this sheet, I will be topic modeling supreme court cases with the following:\n",

Initially I assumed that I would not have any other reasonable options, but LDA has proven ineffective for this project. I've done more reading about the differences between LDA and NMF, and LDA seems to be not so good at picking up subtle differences in a corpus about the same subject (as in, if I wanted to find the difference between Apple products and apple the fruit, LDA would probably work, but not if I need to find the difference between cases where the majority of the text is about the law). My suspicion is that this is because LDA can only use a count vectorizer rather than a tfidf, so this bag of words is a serious limitation to finding how these documents _relate_."
