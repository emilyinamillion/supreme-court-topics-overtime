If you've ever used BeautifulSoup before you know that finding a site where you can find everything you need is great because you can scale up dramatically without any extra work - vs if you find disperate sources you have to write multiple request functions."

I added the bot crawler fakeout header (which you should absolutely do if you are collecting as much data as I naively thought I could collect without a header), which may have solved this problem. However, nothing is worse than waiting 2 hours and coming back to an errored out screen which basically means you'll have to start completely over. So I decided to split them up."
